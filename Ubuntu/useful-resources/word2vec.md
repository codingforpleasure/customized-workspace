## Reductions for computing the `Softmax` function:

### Hierarchical Softmax


where each of the elements of the activated output vector is the probability of the word to be equal to the j-th word in the vocabulary given our input word I. Also, it’s worth mentioning that the sum of the elements of the output vector is equal to 1 and each of the elements of it is mapped into a range [0,1].

The computational complexity of this algorithm computed in a straightforward fashion is the size of our vocabulary, O(V). 


### Negative sampling
